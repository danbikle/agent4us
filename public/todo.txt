This looks like a good place to start learning about RL coding:
https://github.com/matthiasplappert/keras-rl


steps:

git clone https://github.com/matthiasplappert/keras-rl
ln -s keras-rl krl

https://github.com/matthiasplappert/keras-rl#how-do-i-install-it-and-how-do-i-get-started

pip install keras-rl

I dont have pip

I should try conda install keras-rl
that fails
Try          conda install keras-rl -c conda-forge
that fails

I should try to install keras:
conda install keras
that worked

I should try:
pip install keras-rl

It worked:
agent4@agent4:~/krl $ pip install keras-rl

I should find something in krl I can run...

If you want to run the examples, you'll also have to install `gym` by OpenAI.

You'll also need the `h5py` package

conda list|grep h5py
