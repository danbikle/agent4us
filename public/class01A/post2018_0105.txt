sub: cryp4.us, My first draft of class01A is finished.

Hello World,

My first draft of class01A is finished:

http://cryp4.us/cclasses/class01A

This draft is a discussion of some topics described in the first video lecture:

In addition to the discussion I coded up some Python and Java examples which attempt to interact with some of the ideas presented in lecture.

Tomorrow I will start work on class01B.

Holler if questions,
-Dan
