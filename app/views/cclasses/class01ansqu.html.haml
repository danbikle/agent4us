  Answer questions about some API calls in
  %a(href='https://github.com/matthiasplappert/keras-rl/blob/master/examples/dqn_cartpole.py' target='x') dqn_cartpole.py

%ul
  %li
    Where do I find
    %a(href='https://github.com/matthiasplappert/keras-rl/blob/master/examples/dqn_cartpole.py' target='x') dqn_cartpole.py?
  %li
    .syntax
      %pre
        =render 'class01ansqu10'
        
  %li
    Can you describe a use-case solved by
    %a(href='https://github.com/matthiasplappert/keras-rl/blob/master/examples/dqn_cartpole.py' target='x') dqn_cartpole.py?
  %li
    .syntax
      %pre
        =render 'class01ansqu12'

  %li
    Can you describe the imports at the top of
    %a(href='https://github.com/matthiasplappert/keras-rl/blob/master/examples/dqn_cartpole.py' target='x') dqn_cartpole.py?
  %li
    .syntax
      %pre
        =render 'class01ansqu14'

  %li
    After the imports, I see a small group of syntax:
    .syntax
      %pre
        =render 'class01ansqu16'
  %li What does that syntax do?
  %li 
    .syntax
      %pre
        =render 'class01ansqu18'
  %li
    %a(href='https://www.google.com/search?q=In+Reinforcement+Learning,+What+is+an+Episode' target='x')

  %li 
    .syntax
      %pre
        %code
          An example of an episode is one chess match.
          For the cart-pole demo an episode will end in a variety of ways, for example if the pole falls over.

    Returning my attention to:
    %a(href='https://github.com/matthiasplappert/keras-rl/blob/master/examples/dqn_cartpole.py' target='x') dqn_cartpole.py
    I step into the next line of syntax with the pdb-debugger:
    
    .syntax
      %pre
        %code.python env.seed(123)
        
    .syntax
      %pre
        =render 'class01ansqu20'
        
    So, that call: "Sets the seed for this env's random number generator(s)."
  

  %li
    I used the debugger again to study the next line of syntax:
    
    .syntax
      %pre
        %code.python nb_actions = env.action_space.n
        
    .syntax
      %pre
        =render 'class01ansqu22'

    I see that call getting an integer from an attribute called action_space.
    %br/
    This attribute is a function call: Discrete(2).

          https://www.google.com/search?q=In+openai+gym,+what+is+Discrete()?

        This URL gives a simple description:

        Every environment comes with first-class Space objects that describe
        %br/
        the valid actions and observations.
      %li

        The Discrete space allows a fixed range of non-negative numbers,
        %br/
        so in this case valid actions are either 0 or 1.
        %br/
        The Box space represents an n-dimensional box,
        %br/
        so valid observations will be an array of 4 numbers.
      %li

        Box and Discrete are the most common Spaces.
      %li
        For CartPole-v0 one of the actions applies force to the left,
        %br/
        and one of them applies force to the right.

    So, Matthias is setting up a Discrete space which allows the agent
    %br/
    to push the cart in the 0-direction or the 1-direction which might be left or right.
    %br/
    Q: Why is Matthias getting the number of actions from env.action_space.n?
    %br
    A: He needs this integer at two places later in the script:
    %ul
      %li He uses nb_actions to the define number of outputs of a Neural-Net.
      %li He uses nb_actions to help initialize DQNAgent() which constructs an agent for the cart.
