%h1 Class01

%p This class is under construction.

%p One idea I often follow when I teach is "Lab First", "Lecture Second".

%p By "Lab First" I mean that I give you a presentation on how I do the Lab.

%p After that presentation, you should have an opinion about your ability to benefit from this class.

%p Then, I expect you to learn enough from that presentation that you can do the Lab.

%p After you have done the Lab, you will be ready for either Homework or Lecture.

%p Sometimes my Lecture is just a presentation of me doing the Homework exercises.

%p Then your Homework is trying to remember enough from both the Lab and my presentations to do the Homework exercises.
